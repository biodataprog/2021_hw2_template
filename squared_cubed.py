# write your code below you can use
# range(MaxNum)
# as a way to get numbers from 0...MaxNum
# eg
# for n in range(MaxNum):
#    # code here
# to convert a number into strings
# numstring = str(number)
# or
# numstring = "%d"%(number)
# if you wanted to show scientific notation when num get very large
# numstring = "%g"%(number)
